		<p> Some really interesting comments, and there are a few comments about skill and 10x developers that really made me think. </p>
		<p>For those who work inside Google, it’s well worth it to look at Jeff &amp; Sanjay’s commit history and code review dashboard. They aren’t actually all that much more productive in terms of code written than a decent SWE3 who knows his codebase.</p>

<pre><code>The reason they have a reputation as rockstars is that they can apply this productivity to things that really matter; they’re able to pick out the really important parts of the problem and then focus their efforts there, so that the end result ends up being much more impactful than what the SWE3 wrote. The SWE3 may spend his time writing a bunch of unit tests that catch bugs that wouldn’t really have happened anyway, or migrating from one system to another that isn’t really a large improvement, or going down an architectural dead end that’ll just have to be rewritten later. Jeff or Sanjay (or any of the other folks operating at that level) will spend their time running a proposed API by clients to ensure it meets their needs, or measuring the performance of subsystems so they fully understand their building blocks, or mentally simulating the operation of the system before building it so they rapidly test out alternatives. They don’t actually write more code than a junior developer (oftentimes, they write less), but the code they do write gives them more information, which makes them ensure that they write the rightcode.

I feel like this point needs to be stressed a whole lot more than it is, as there’s a whole mythology that’s grown up around 10x developers that’s not all that helpful. In particular, people need to realize that these developers rapidly become 1x developers (or worse) if you don’t let them make their own architectural choices - the reason they’re excellent in the first place is because they know how to determine if certain work is going to be useless and avoid doing it in the first place. If you dictate that they do it anyway, they’re going to be just as slow as any other developer
</code></pre>

<p>This is a really intersting comment about 10x programmers not actually being that much more productive and it made me think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYXLyantCxfr6uF6zUTxQLg">Mark&rsquo;s Drawing Tutorials</a>&rsquo; &ldquo;drawing system&rdquo;, where he treats drawing as a system of interconnected skills where every single one has to be functional for your &ldquo;drawing system&rdquo; to work and thus be able to draw. There are some other extrapolations about this, because if you realise that every skill has its own diminishing returns curve, you&rsquo;re better off not fully mastering any one subsystem and moving on to the next important one, and if there are ways to train more than one system at a time, you should do that. I think you can apply this idea to practically any skill, and adopt the mindset that getting better is more about knowing how to get better and doing that, and less about how much raw effort you try to put in.</p>

<p>there was also another comment about leaving a bad job, because if you waste your time doing a bad job, and you don&rsquo;t learn anything during that time and just constantly feel burned out, that&rsquo;s improvement you&rsquo;re losing out on, and he goes on to say that improvement is like compound interest, if you get a little bit better now you are a lot better later, because the skills you learnt will accelerate your learning for other skills</p>

<pre><code>I am 42-year-old very successful programmer who has been through a lot of situations in my career so far, many of them highly demotivating. And the best advice I have for you is to get out of what you are doing. Really. Even though you state that you are not in a position to do that, you really are. It is okay. You are free. Okay, you are helping your boyfriend’s startup but what is the appropriate cost for this? Would he have you do it if he knew it was crushing your soul?

I don’t use the phrase “crushing your soul” lightly. When it happens slowly, as it does in these cases, it is hard to see the scale of what is happening. But this is a very serious situation and if left unchecked it may damage the potential for you to do good work for the rest of your life.

The commenters who are warning about burnout are right. Burnout is a very serious situation. If you burn yourself out hard, it will be difficult to be effective at any future job you go to, even if it is ostensibly a wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical injury. I burned myself out once and it took at least 12 years to regain full productivity. Don’t do it.

* More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel joy and excitement about programming-related things, you’ll be unable to do the best work. That this issue is separate from and parallel to burnout! If you are burned out, you might still be able to feel the joy and excitement briefly at the start of a project/idea, but they will fade quickly as the reality of day-to-day work sets in. Alternatively, if you are not burned out but also do not have a sense of wonder, it is likely you will never get yourself started on the good work.

* The earlier in your career it is now, the more important this time is for your development. Programmers learn by doing. If you put yourself into an environment where you are constantly challenged and are working at the top threshold of your ability, then after a few years have gone by, your skills will have increased tremendously. It is like going to intensively learn kung fu for a few years, or going into Navy SEAL training or something. But this isn’t just a one-time constant increase. The faster you get things done, and the more thorough and error-free they are, the more ideas you can execute on, which means you will learn faster in the future too. Over the long term, programming skill is like compound interest. More now means a LOT more later. Less now means a LOT less later.

So if you are putting yourself into a position that is not really challenging, that is a bummer day in and day out, and you get things done slowly, you aren’t just having a slow time now. You are bringing down that compound interest curve for the rest of your career. It is a serious problem. If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly cut out all the shitty jobs I did (and there were many of them)
</code></pre>

<p>This was another very good comment. It&rsquo;s funny that these comments sound insightful in the context of programming, but when it comes to drawing, the equivalent advice is almost normal and part of the collective consciousness. It is stressed quite often that people learn better by making more shitty drawings and people learn even better if they draw many good drawings. In this sense, there is definitely a sense of compound interest; the better you get at drawing, the better you get at getting better at drawing.</p>
