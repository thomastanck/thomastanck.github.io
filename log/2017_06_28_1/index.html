		<p> Was my first time ever writing a bash completion script. Works pretty well! </p>
		<p>It was very interesting poking into the <code>find</code> man page.
That page is extremely long!</p>

<p>The cddots commands originaly made by <a href="https://github.com/mortie/nixConf/commit/7c368e6392e31b638d8f6282a159e263303ecadc">my friend mort</a>
is really a family of aliases
<code>..</code> <code>...</code>, and so on
that <code>cd</code> upwards.
If given an argument
it then <code>cd</code> downwards into that directory.</p>

<p>I noticed that it couldn&rsquo;t tab-complete
since bash doesn&rsquo;t know
that these commands are really <code>cd</code>
from a different (higher) working directory.
Since I wanted to learn to use <code>..</code> more often,
seeing this behaviour made me not want to use it anymore,
up until I thought
maybe I should just make a bash completion script for it.</p>

<p>This experience ended up taking mor time than it would ever save,
but hey, I learnt something new today!</p>
