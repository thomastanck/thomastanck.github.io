		<p>It was really frustrating
when I found out that the reason why
3 finger drag
(and other gestures,
but 3 finger drag was the most noticeable)
wasn&rsquo;t working properly
was because of <strong>INTEGER TRUNCATION</strong>.
Such an elementary error&hellip;
it was causing input to be ignored
and thus my selections and drags would always start late
and never be precise.</p>

<p>Turns out all the previous maintainers
never bothered to compile with warning flags either,
but even that would not have prevented the error,
because the integer truncation was done with an <strong>EXPLCIT</strong> <code>(int)</code> cast!
<em>Holy shit!</em></p>
