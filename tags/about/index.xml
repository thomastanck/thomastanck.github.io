      <description>I am a student who aims to eventually do research in Machine Learning, though I&amp;rsquo;m still very far from that.
My hobbies tend to come and go, but my hobbies have ranged from piano, osu!, programming, Japanese, to even sewing. My current hobby is playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 while listening to podcasts.
This blog is self hosted on GitHub Pages at thomastanck.github.io and has a GitHub repository at thomastanck/log. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo with a slightly modified version of the hugo-dusk theme.</description>
