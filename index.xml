      <description>Welcome to my log. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting many links to sites with a record of my thoughts and comments on such articles, with occasional long form articles (which I predict I will never actually get around to). In a way, this is just a tumblr replacement. However, I think there was merit in learning how to set up a microblog with Hugo, so this was absolutely not a waste of time.</description>

      <description>I am a student who aims to eventually do research in Machine Learning, though I&amp;rsquo;m still very far from that.
My hobbies tend to come and go, but my hobbies have ranged from piano, osu!, programming, Japanese, to even sewing. My current hobby is playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 while listening to podcasts.
This blog is self hosted on GitHub Pages at thomastanck.github.io and has a GitHub repository at thomastanck/log. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo with a slightly modified version of the hugo-dusk theme.</description>
