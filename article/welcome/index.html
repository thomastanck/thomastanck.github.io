Here I&rsquo;ll be posting many links to sites with a record of my thoughts and comments on such articles, with occasional long form articles (which I predict I will never actually get around to).

<p><em>/me stops rationalising</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not called a <em>blog</em> because in the usual sense of the word, that implies longer form articles. It is not called <em>&ldquo;microblog&rdquo;</em> as I think that&rsquo;s a mouthful to type. Hence, it is called a <em>log</em>, in the sense of a computer log, just more human.</p>

<p>Anyways, have fun reading this <em>log</em>, I guess.</p> </div>
