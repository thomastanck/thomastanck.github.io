      <description>Welcome to my log. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting many links to sites with a record of my thoughts and comments on such articles, with occasional long form articles (which I predict I will never actually get around to). In a way, this is just a tumblr replacement. However, I think there was merit in learning how to set up a microblog with Hugo, so this was absolutely not a waste of time.</description>
